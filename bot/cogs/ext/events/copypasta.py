    "that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only "
    "function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU "
    "operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called “Linux” "
