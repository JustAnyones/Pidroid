    "of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities "
    "and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.\n\n"

    "Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. "
    "Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called “Linux”, "
    "and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.\n\n"

    "There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. "
    "Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine’s resources to the other programs "
    "that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only "
    "function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU "
    "operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called “Linux” "
    "distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux."
